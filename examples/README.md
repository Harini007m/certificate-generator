# Example Files

This directory contains example files to help you understand the expected format for student data.

## sample_students.csv

A sample CSV file showing the expected format for student data:
- **Name**: Full name of the student
- **Department**: Student's department or branch
- **Class**: Year, semester, or class designation
- **Email**: Email address (optional, but required for sending certificates)

## Creating Your Own Template

You can create a certificate template using any image editing software:

1. **Recommended Size**: 1920x1080 pixels (landscape) or A4 size
2. **Format**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, or PDF
3. **Design Tips**:
   - Leave space in the center for student name (will be placed at ~45% from top)
   - Leave space below for department and class information
   - Use high contrast background for text visibility
   - Consider adding your institution logo, seal, or signature

### Text Placement (default positions):
- **Name**: Center, 45% from top (large font, bold)
- **Department**: Center, 60% from top (medium font)
- **Class**: Center, 68% from top (medium font)

These positions work well for most templates but can be customized in the code if needed.
